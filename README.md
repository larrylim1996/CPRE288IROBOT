This is the project for CPRE288. 

The goal of this project is to allow the iRobot to traverse through hazards and position itself in the retrieval zone.

The iRobot has to be controlled remotely via Putty and do the following:
1. Able to be initiated remotely at the start of test.
2. Able to be set in standby when it has reached the retrieval zone.
3. Able to indicate the retrieval zone has been found and prepare for positioning in the zone.
4. Have control over the basic movements.
5. Have control over all the sensors.

Autonomous movement and object identification is a plus.
